<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a sophomore at the University of Central Florida pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science. Before attending UCF, I attended Seminole State College of Florida where I earned my Associate in Arts and graduated Summa Cum Laude. While attending Seminole State, I worked as a Code Sensei at Code Ninjas, an after-school coding program. While working there I helped teach fundamental programming concepts to children ages 7 to 14. I also helped organize and modify the curriculum. I enjoy learning different skills through programming in my free time. Currently, I am learning how to build a website from the ground up!</p>
